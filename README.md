# Fake-news-detection

We have two csv file one is of fake news and other is of true or real news.

We labelled both files with real and fake and concatanate both of them and suffle it.

We had done data extraction and data cleansing as our text contain special characters and csv file have many variable that has no need.

We visualise graph and plot it for many varable.

We apply machine learning model to find out the accuracy.

We apply to different code ti plot the confusion matrix. first is by defining function in python and other by direct using of sklearn library function.
